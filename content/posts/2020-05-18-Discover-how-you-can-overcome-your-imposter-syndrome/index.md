_Feel comfortable with being uncomfortable_ they say. Although, confidence doesn’t come with daily practice in the mirror, but with a process! Here are five steps to overcome your imposter syndrome:

1. Trust in the long-term result
2. Don’t compare yourself with other people
3. Focus on one only area
4. Relate your activities to your learning
5. Test what you learned

Practicing helps to embrace your fears and thoughts of failure. Because no matter how many courses on the subject you take or books of self-confidence you read. **If you don’t put yourself into action, a lack of confidence will always follow you.**

### 1. Trust in the long-term result

**It’s normal** **to be an unhealthy perfectionist** when we are learning or already had a bad experience. But it’s impossible to be perfect at the beginning because even the most [successful people have a track record of failures](https://www.businessinsider.com/successful-people-who-failed-at-first-2015-7).

I can even hear _the perfectionist voice_ that tells me I should study more before writing this. But I also know **this is just practice for doing better work and to support a bigger personal plan.**

### 2. Don’t compare yourself with other people

We are used to see the success of people by social networks. But we forget they are only sharing the good parts they want us to see. And, **we don’t look into the mistakes and sacrifices behind those moments of success.**

When I started as head of projects at my small non-profit. I used to feel intimidated at events with larger organizations. Because I only had a few active projects. **But comparisons were out of sense!** They had many more people, money, and years of experience!

**It is usual to diminish our worth when comparing our efforts versus other people’s success.** This is something that Forbes also highlights in [six steps to overcoming imposter syndrome.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2018/07/27/six-steps-to-overcoming-imposter-syndrome/#20cb05d93152)

### 3. Focus on one only area

Any learning curve is always a challenge. So, why complicating it learning many different things?!

> Face it. You can learn anything but not everything! — Not at the same time.

As part of my internship activities at Intel. I had to research and test very different technologies. I needed to find and report the best solutions for potential bugs. **Being focused helped me to learn more in less time.**

- **Make a list** with all you want to learn, their difficulty, and impact. Doing a table in excel works fine.
- **Identify _areas_** of complementary knowledge. Like programming with UI principles. But not mixed with copywriting! Move that to another _area_.
- **Assign the priority** of each _area_ and a period of time to focus on learning all those subjects related to it. It can be a week per _area_.

### 4. Relate your activities to your learning

Make hobbies to support your learning. Change the topic of youtube videos, podcasts, and even people you follow in social media. **Doing it will help you to feel more comfortable with the jargon and review your new knowledge.**

Last year, we started using React.JS to improve my job’s website. It was hard for me to learn on the go and being a confident communicator in our _code reviews_. But all changed after using my hobbies to keep in touch with programming and public speaking:

- **Watching instructive videos** instead of another Netflix chapter.
- **Switching some Spotify songs** to one podcast episode.
- **Reading articles** instead of memes on social media**.**

If you struggle with having this kind of supporting hobbies. Watch this Google Engineer’s Ted Talk. So you can have fun while forming new learning habits!

### 5. Test what you learned

Talk to your friends about what you’re learning. Try to explain to them that new thing you learned. It will make you practice and feel confident about the topic.

Last year, my friends and I met every Saturday in a different café. The plan was talking about whatever we learned in the week from work, books, or podcasts. Even it was an excuse for meeting more often. We practiced what we learned and discovered interesting places in the city!

> Listening to other people’s learning experiences helps you to relax. You can observe that everybody is in a learning curve and nobody is an expert at everything.

**The most important thing is discovering how you learn** and adapt it to your daily routine.

It gives you the confidence to learn anything and the sureness that fear is just the beginning of any new experience.
